# Outside of this code section, write the (R)Markdown syntax that:
# - States the name of your band
# - Displays the bio you just retrieved 
# - Shows the image of your band

### Bonus ###
# Make another request, and retrieve/display the band's top songs
# Wrap the above steps in a function that takes a band as a parameter, and returns the desired info
```
My favorite band is Walk the Moon. They are really cool.
Here's their bio: `r first_bio`
Their best songs are:

- Avalanche
- Cough Syrup
- Aquaman

Here's a photo of them:
